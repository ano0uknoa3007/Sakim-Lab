# Sakim Lab

Website for Sakim Lab: bars, restaurants and places created in Lisbon over 30+ years.

## Pages

The site is one long page, `index.html`: light paper, huge condensed type with photos set inside the lines, and a black pill bar on top.

| Section | What happens |
|---|---|
| Hero | The headline over columns of bar photos drifting on their own; the photo inside the headline changes by itself; under the cursor the headline ripples like water |
| Studio | An editorial page between two rules: the quote, the numbers, two columns of text |
| Services | Four big lines that open on click; a round photo and a round colour follow the mouse |
| Projects | A horizontal gallery: the section holds still while scrolling down moves sideways through one big photo per bar; it opens the project over the page (swiped on phones) |
| Process | One evening from 18:00 to opening: the five steps on a line that moves sideways as you scroll, the section going from day to night (down the page on phones) |
| About | Each value is a round photo with a round colour that slides out on hover |
| Contact | The big lines again, then the ways to reach him |

A card at the bottom of the screen opens the booking conversation from anywhere.

Every time the home page loads (and when the logo is clicked) an intro plays: the logo, the name in a pill, a window onto a bar that fills the screen and then lands inside the headline. A click skips it. It does not play for links to a section or a project (`index.html#projectos`, `index.html#/so-what`), or with reduced motion.

Other files:

| File | Page |
|---|---|
| `lugares/<project>.html` | One page per project (also opens over the home page): name, description, the services it had, a still map of where it is, and its photos in a grid |
| `editor.html` | The home page, still (no animations), with every text and photo editable in place (photos can also be swapped or added, up to 20 per project, from the computer or from the archived photos in `arquivo/`), the main colours, and the project pages opening over it. Changes stay in that browser; "Alterações" downloads them as a file to send to Claude, "HTML" downloads the page as it looks. Built from `tools/editor.html`; `python3 tools/editor_local.py` makes it one offline file (`sakim-editor.html`, not committed) |
| `contacto.html` | Book a conversation (it also opens as a side panel from every page) |
| `lugares.html`, `sobre.html`, `metodo.html` | Old addresses; they forward to their section |

All pages are generated. **Don't edit the HTML files by hand.** The words are in `tools/content.py` (taken from the original site, PT and EN), the photos in `tools/places.py`, and the layout in `tools/build.py`. After a change, run:

```bash
python3 tools/build.py
```

## Project pages

- **Where it is:** `GEO` in `tools/places.py` (coordinates, zoom, and `pin`, `area` or nothing while the address is unknown). The map is drawn with MapLibre (`assets/js/maplibre-gl.js`, loaded only when a map comes into view) from OpenFreeMap: free, no API key, fine for commercial use. It is a still picture, not draggable.
- **Which services it had:** `SERVICES_DONE` in `tools/places.py`, e.g. `"some-project": ["A", "B"]`. Projects not listed had all four.
- **Photo sizes:** photos that were sharp to begin with are shown larger. Their original sizes are in `tools/photo_sizes.json`.

## Adding or changing photos

1. Put the photo in `assets/img/lugares/<place>/`.
2. Add it to that place's `photos` list in `tools/places.py`, in the position it should appear on the page.
3. Run `python3 tools/build.py`. The build stops if a listed photo is missing.

To show a photo from the archive, add it to the list the same way.
